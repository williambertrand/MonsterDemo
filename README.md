# MonsterDemo
Quick monster game in unity

## Monster Behaviors
Monster has a `StateMachine` that handles moving in and out of different behavioral states.

All the different states can be found here: [MonsterStates scripts folder](https://github.com/williambertrand/MonsterDemo/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/MonsterStates)

## Player Interactions
Anything the player can intereact with should inherit from [Interactable](https://github.com/williambertrand/MonsterDemo/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/EnvElements/Interactable.cs)

## Env Events
Still thinking of ways to improve this using Unity Events.
